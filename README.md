# FinalProject
A Final Project for ML
## Data description
Traffic data collected from the several Wavetronix radar sensors deployed by the City of Austin. Dataset is augmented with geo coordinates from sensor location dataset.
## Environment configuration
- Python 3.7
- Tensorflow 2.2.0
- Keras 2.4.3
## Experiment procedure
1) Add `Radar_Traffic_Counts.csv` to the `./data` directory
2) Run python `main.py`
3) Model information will be saved in the `./model` directory, loss plot and prediction plot will be saved in the `./image` directory
4) Find more details in `Report.md`
